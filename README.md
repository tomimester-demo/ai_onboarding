# AI-Powered Personalized Onboarding Emails

Automates **personalized onboarding emails** for new members of *Data Science Klub* using Python + LLMs. Reads a Typeform onboarding survey, builds a structured prompt, generates a tailored HTML email via OpenAI, and sends it through the Brevo API.

## ðŸ“ˆ Why

- **Goal:** Improve early retention by guiding members to the right starting materials.
- **Impact:** Retention rose from ~25% â†’ **40â€“50%** by month 3.
- **Cost:** Only cents/month for LLM usage.
- **Speed:** End-to-end in ~4â€“5 minutes.
- **UX:** Positive member feedback â€” emails feel personal and helpful.

## âš™ How it Works

1. **Typeform webhook** posts the onboarding form JSON.
2. **Parser** cleans and normalizes answers into a `qa_dict`.
3. **Prompt builder** merges:
   - Context & style rules
   - Member answers
   - Content catalogue (talks/courses with audience tags)
4. **Business rules** classify member (*beginner* vs *not beginner*), select content.
5. **OpenAI API** generates HTML email body.
6. **Brevo API** sends the email.
